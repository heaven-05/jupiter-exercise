1. **Imports a video**
2. **Analyzes the video and generates a summary of the video**
3. **Uses GPT to generate a set of quiz questions based on the video summary**
4. **Converts these quiz questions to audio using Whisper**
5. **Commits your code to a GitHub repository and adds `github.com/EWizardII` to the repo**

## Steps

### 1. Import a Video

- Choose a video file you would like to work with.
- Use appropriate Python libraries to import the video into your Jupyter Notebook.

### 2. Analyze the Video and Generate a Summary

- Use machine learning models to analyze the video content.
- Generate a concise summary of the video's main points and themes.

### 3. Generate Quiz Questions

- Utilize GPT to generate a set of quiz questions based on the summary.
- Aim for a variety of question types (multiple-choice, true/false, short answer).

### 4. Convert Quiz Questions to Audio

- Use Whisper or a similar text-to-speech library to convert the generated quiz questions into audio format.

### 5. Commit to GitHub

- Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and functional.
- Commit your Jupyter Notebook and any associated files to a GitHub repository.
- Add `github.com/EWizardII` to the repository as a collaborator.
